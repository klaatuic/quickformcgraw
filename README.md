A quick mail form for Interchange Strap with basic bot check

This is my bumbling attempt to make a quick email form for IC using strap template. Its a hodge podge of old and new IC code as you will see though I have tried make it self explanatory.

The goal was to build a quick and dirty custom IC fill in form that would be emailed on submission.

It had to include the following:
- Simple install and can be quickly used for custom fill out forms.
- No table to be installed (data not saved)
- Use IC - Strap validation messages/design.
- Emails use IC validation
- Custom email sent to designated address.
- Had to have a level of captcha without having to wade through installing perl modules or try to understand the captcha tag options.
- Had to have some kind of flood control.

The two page here meets these requirments in a cascading meandering stumbling way. Amazing what even a klutz can achieve with Interchange. 

Copy the two pages into the pages directory and adjust the file names, form values and validation requirements as needed.

Helpful hints on how to improve this appreciated. Be nice!! Free to use caution no guarantees. If its that bad I can take it down or improve on it.
